title: Eco Food Calc
description: An open source tool for the game Eco to optimize your in-game diet.
longDescription: I found a tool for a game I played (Eco) that was useful for calculating the in-game optimal diet. But I noticed that the tool had really basic UI and some bad UX. In the readme the maintainer was looking for someone to do the design. So I went and designed in Figma, showed it to the maintainer and he loved it so I coded it and overhauled the entire UI and submitted a pull request.
