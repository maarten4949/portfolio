description: An e-commerce site for selling pottery workshops.
longDescription: This is an e-commerce site that started as a small two-person assignment in high school (basic CRUD website, only adding, updating, inserting and deleting products as an admin was required). My teammate wanted to use it in production, but wasn’t that interested in programming herself, so I continued working on the site after high school, adding new features and improving the webshop as a freelance developer. I made the entire backend in php, I also did all the frontend javascript and about 80% of frontend html and css.
