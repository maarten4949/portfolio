experience: I have been using Github since highschool where I used it for Aller Tourner to be able to save my code online and collaborate. In college I learned more about Github, version control and team collaboration (different branches, pull requests, prefixes, project boards etc).
projects: ["en/allertourner", "en/smartdesk", "en/ecofoodcalc"]
